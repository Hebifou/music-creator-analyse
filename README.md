[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://music-creator-analyse.streamlit.app/)

*A data-inspired prototype exploring how creative professionals in the music industry  
could use interactive tools to find venues, collaborators, and media partners.*

## Concept

This project is an **experimental Streamlit demo** built to explore  
how **data and UI design** can support decision-making for independent musicians,  
event organizers, and music marketing professionals.

It is **not a production-ready product**,  
but a conceptual exploration of what a *data-driven creative assistant* might look like.
